# plan ahead
This project was started as I found myself a frequent Calendar App user, the usage grew more frequent as I stepped into the working world as I scheduled meetings with several individuals. Hence, it inspired me to work on a Calendar app myself as most of the time, I found myself switching between weather for the weather forecasts and the calendar app to arrange my meetings, which came to my mind that what if an app could hold all these data, allowing user not having to switch between several apps.
