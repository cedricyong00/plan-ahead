# plan ahead
This project was started as I found myself a frequent Calendar App user, the usage grew more frequent as I stepped into the working world as I scheduled meetings with several individuals. 

Hence, it inspired me to work on a Calendar app myself as most of the time, I found myself switching between weather for the weather forecasts and the calendar app to arrange my meetings, which came to my mind that what if an app could hold all these data, allowing user not having to switch between several apps.

1) Coming to the home page of the app, you would find your personal schedule data table, followed by the holiday data that is filtered down to only upcoming public holiday.

Lastly, the weather data table that shows forecasts up to 5 days in advance from the day you visit the app.

2) By pressing "Add Plans" on the nav bar (Top of the page), it routes you to a separate page where there are input fields for you to add any new plans accordingly with the following 3 fields :

Event: What event is it?
Date: Date of the event
Remarks: Any remarks

After inputting, you could simply press on the "Add" button and these data would then reflect on the home page where your personal schedule data is shown.

<br />

3) By pressing "Update Plans" on the nav bar, it routes you to another separate page where there is a dropdown box for you to select existing events that you have planned previously, and it would update the rest of the fields accordingly if you were to change any of the field's value
